news-on-time - A virtual notice board
=====================================


This project is a web application which plays the role of a notice board. It started as an idea to solve the defeciencies of the email system of communicating events to the Ashesi University College community. The app provides a central hub where members can post and view information regarding social events and activities happening on campus.

Problem and Solution Generation
-------------------------------

### Scenario Name
News on time

### Problems Identified
Students who do not have email privileges to the whole school normally advertise through the few notice boards around the school. However, this has come to be a rather inefficient means because:
* Students rarely pay attention to the notice boards
* Sometimes when they do pay attention, the event has already happened
* Strong winds sometimes blow the fliers off the notice boards
* The information cannot be accessed from off campus.

### Payoff
With the news on time app:
* Students without email privileges can advertise or convey messages to the Ashesi community
* News is categorized into different genres
* You can conveniently check news and notices from your laptop instead of walking to a notice board
* All notices seen are not in the past.
