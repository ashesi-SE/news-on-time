<p>News-on-Time is a web application which plays the role of a notice board. The app provides a central hub where customers (students of <a href="https://www.ashesi.edu.gh/">Ashesi University College</a>) can post and view information regarding social events and activities happening on campus.</p>

<a id="the-scenario" class="anchor" href="#the-scenario" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Scenario</h2>

<p>On the Ashesi University College campus, there are a few avenues through which students receive information and news. These avenues include, the email system, the notice boards, local television advertisements, by word of mouth and occasional promotional stands. News is not always evenly distributed amongst the whole student body despite the number of information outlets since it get difficult keeping up with all the news updates from all these sources. An interesting fact on the campus is that most students spend most of their time using electronic devices. <a href="https://github.com/ashesi-SE/news-on-time/wiki/Problem-Scenario">problem scenario in detail</a>.</p>
